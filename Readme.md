# Moviefy
### Moviefy is an end-to-end Machine Learning project. It is similar to IMDb along with a crisp of machine learning to recommend you movies based on your search history. Simply put a Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict the “rating” or “preference” of a user towards a domain-specific item or item. In our case, this domain-specific item is a movie. There are different filtration strategies but we in this project I have used <b>Item-based Collaborative Filtering</b>

### Recommendation systems are one of the widely used applications of Data Science in most companies based on products and online services. As a beginner, it is important to get a good grasp on how to implement such recommendation systems. By building this project, it will help me in understanding how this systems work and boost my skills.
